# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
Introduction:  

             Car Price Prediction is a really an interesting machine learning problem as there are many 
factors that influence the price of a car in the second-hand market. In this competition, we will be looking 
at a dataset based on sale/purchase of cars where our end goal will be to predict the price of the car given 
its features to maximize the prof


Deliverable:
1. Hypothesis Generation.
2. Data Exploration.
3. Data Cleaning.
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building.

Technique:

After Feature Engineering processes ,I will use different
Modeling technique like linear regression,Ridge Regression Model
,Elastic Net Regression Model etc.After that we will select one of these
Model which will predicting best product.


DATA SET: CAR PRICE PREDICTION



DATA SET:DATA FEILDS
Record_id - a id unique to a given car record
Title - essential information about the car like maker, model etc
Model - model of a particular car
Make - manufacturer of the car
Badge - further information like model type specific to each car
Year - year of manufacture of car
City - city of where the car is located
State - state/province of where the car is located
Body_type - refers to the shape (car body) of a particular car
Fuel_type - fuel that is used to provide power to the car
Km_driven - number of miles travelled or covered
Price - current price of the car



CONCLUSION
I applied couple of regression models on dataset. From the final dataframe, it gives opinion about
the score of models and also the plots help us to understand which models is more succesful.




You can run this program on many paltforms which you want

1>.-> jupyter NoteBook
2>.> Pycharm
